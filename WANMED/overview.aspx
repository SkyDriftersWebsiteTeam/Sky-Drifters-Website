    <h1>OVERVIEW</h1>
            <p>
                To All:
            </p><p>
                Captain Ryouji of the Worlds Adrift Naval Military Enforcement Division, First Fleet. Herin lies an invitation to join us as a force for preserving the peace.
            </p><p>
                Ours is an organization of Order. As such, there will be a strict adherence to Customs and Courtesies, as well as Chain of Command. All orders given must be Lawful and Within Reason. Any orders given that do are not will be brought to the attention of an immediate supervisor, and taken up the chain until handled.
            </p><p>
                Willful Disobeying orders can result in Non-Judicial Punishment. Punishment will fit the order which was disobeyed. Punishment can range from a probationary period, reduction in rank, and discharge from WANMED, but not Sky Drifters.
            </p><p>
                Dissent is punishable by no less than discharge from WANMED, but not from Sky Drifters.
            </p><p>
                Mutiny is punishable by discharge from WANMED, and, if applicable (as per Day0x) removal from Sky Drifters as a whole. This is handled case-by-case.
            </p><p>
                Recruiting:
                Sign up is completely voluntary, and is not required in order to be part of Sky Drifters. This is merely a sub-faction for those in Sky Drifters who wish to preserve the peace, and do so in an effective, orderly fashion. Unlike the actual military, there are no contractual agreements other than adherence to Customs and Courtesies and Chain of Command whilst being apart of WANMED. Members may leave at any time of their choosing, should they find that this lifestyle is not for them. Leaving of WANMED requires surrender of all property deemed WANMED’s, including, but not limited to, ships built by WANMED, for WANMED, standard issue equipment, and resources given for the development of WANMED equipment or ships. Uniforms, if applicable, may be kept, but cannot be worn by any member not actively part of WANMED excepting in cases of ceremony.
            </p><p>
                Now that the rules (which may be edited at a later time as is deemed necessary by myself, anyone in command appointed by myself, or Day0x) are out of the way, we shall talk about our mission.
            </p><p>
                Our mission here at the Worlds Adrift Naval Military Enforcement Division consist of three prime directives. These are summarized as follows:
            </p><p>
            <b>Protect</b> our (Sky Drifter’s) airspace.
            <br /><b>Prevent</b> over consumption of resources/and or environment.
            <br /><b>Defend</b> against piracy.
            </p><p>
                The first directive: Protect our airspace
                Our mission is to ensure that the airspace, claimed by Sky Drifter’s is protected against any threat, foreign or domestic. Threats include enemy activity within our airspace, violations of rules laid out by Day0x within our airspace, and piracy. All subsequent directives apply within our airspace.
            </p><p>
                The second directive: Prevent over consumption of resources/and or environment
                Our mission is to prevent mass consumption of resources and/or depletion of such within our airspace. Resources are valuable, both in necessity for maintaining our economy in Sky Drifters, as well as maintaining a habitable zone within which we operate. This also extend to environment. Environment includes flora and fauna. Animals are important to maintaining a healthy ecosystem. Plants are required for animals to feed upon. Both are renewable, but depletion can easily occur if care is not taken to monitor their numbers. Depletion of resources will result in the world dying, and if it dies, we die.
            </p><p>
                The third directive: Defend against piracy
                Piracy is something that can plague all individuals. Our goal is defend against pirates, as well as defend those who fall victim to piracy. WANMED is simultaneously a Military Operation and a Humanitarian Effort. We will defend those who are unable to defend themselves. Distress calls will be answered with a sense of urgency and will be taken very seriously. This extends to those who may have been marooned by pirates after losing their vessel.
            </p><p>
                Also,
                In respect to Faction Sovereignty (In reference to the 1648 Treaty of Westphalia, that established Nation-State sovereignty), WANMED will not conduct activities within airspace deemed to be controlled by other Factions, lest they be deemed pirate factions. Activities will only be conducted within another Faction’s airspace should said faction require aid in any task they deem unable to handle by themselves.
            </p><p>
                We are not a warring faction, nor do we intend to be. We will defend against threats if necessary, and threats will be responded to with lethal force. Our goals are Peace, Sustainability, and Order.
            </p><p>
                In closing,
                As stated before, WANMED is not for everyone, it is entirely voluntary and is not required in order to join Sky Drifters as a whole. I hope that you will consider joining our organization, to help us maintain Peace, Sustainability, and Order.

                Prevent
                Defend,
            </p><p>
                Captain Ryouji
            </p>
